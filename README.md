# MLfingerprint

Project to classify the Time Frequency Map (TFmap) of the fingerprint on SEEG, using machine leaning models.

## Description

The TF map are created and processed on Matlab before to be the inputs of this project.
Different models are investigated to extract features of the images, then the affinity propagation method is used
to classify the images. 

## Python libraries

- Tensorflow (To extract features of the images)
- sklearn (Cluster classification model)
- numpy
